                <li><span class="label label-info">optional</span> The NRPSDesigner database can be extended with newly discovered synthetase sequences. </li>
          
              </div>

             <h2> Novel NRPS </h2>
             <p> The core functionality of the NRPSDesigner can be accessed by clicking on the "Apps" dropdown and then on the "NRPS Designer" button. Users that have been logged in, will be able to immediately proceed with the design of their synthetase of choice. Registered users will be redirected to their collection of already designed synthetases and thus will be able to reinspect or continue working on one of these or to design a new one. </p>
                <h3> Input </h3>
                <p> The input basically only consists of a sequence of monomers (amino acids) out of which the final non-ribosomal peptide (NRP) should consist. This is achieved with the user-friendly interface shown below: </p>
                <img src={% static "images/documentation/nrpSelection.png" %} />

                <p> The functionality of the interface can be accessed mainly by the following 3 buttons </p>
                <dl>
                   
                  <dt>Add monomer</dt>
                  <dd>When you want to elongate the sequence of monomers by one, you should press this button. Note that
                  you can click on the chosen monomers and then possibly replace the selection by choosing another one
                  from the dropdown. In addition, L or D-configurations can be selected, which is one of the 
                  characteristics making NRPS so special. Also note that the monomer choices available will depend on the specificities of the adenylation domains available in the NRPSDesigner database and 
                  the chirality of the preceding monomer, as dictated by the rules of NRP synthesis. Finally, the peptide to be assembled is also presented graphically in the panel to the right.</dd>
                   <dt>Use curated domains only</dt>
                  <dd>The NRPSDesigner makes it very easy to extend the database with novel NRPS genes and every user
                  can do so (see below). Those genes and domains will also be used in the NRPSDesigner algorithm, if the
                  above button has not been pressed. On the other hand, if it has been selected, then only
                  domains curated by the authors, or other scientists with NRPS expertise (curators) will be utilized.</dd>
                  <dt>Design construct</dt>
                  <dd>Once all preferences have been set, the "Design construct" button can be pressed and a request will be
                  sent to the NRPSDesigner database.</dd>
                </dl>
                <h3> Domain Output </h3>
                 <p> Once the request to the NRPSDesigner has been processed, the optimal NRPS domain sequence
                  according to evolutionary distance, cloning practicability and experimentally characterized interactions is calculated by a rule-based algorithm (Dijkstra's algorithm). The visualization returned shows the domains which are necessary for the production of a synthetase capable of producing a peptide of choice. </p>

                <img src={% static "images/documentation/domains.png" %} />
                <h3> Plasmid view </h3>
                <p> The NRPS domains shown in the previous visualization are encoded on the coding DNA sequences. Thus as also exemplified in the screenshot below, the next step through the NRPSDesigner wizard leads to the actual DNA sequences and the fragments that have to be assembled. </p>

                <img src={% static "images/documentation/gibthon1.png" %} />

                <p> Note that each fragment shown in the plasmid map corresponds to a particular sequence that has to be amplified by PCR from a source organism. For example, the clicked fragment above, corresponds to a DNA sequence that has to be amplified from <i> Brevibacillus parabrevis </i> strain atcc 8185/dsm362. Also observe that this fragment codes for more than one domains, namely a condensation, an adenylation and a thiolation domain. In particular, the rules for weight assignment in the application of Dijkstra's algorithm also enforce the minimization of number of fragments that have to be amplified. Thus, less cloning steps will be necessary and less native NRPS domain interfaces will be disrupted. </p>

                <p> The DNA sequences of all those fragments can be downloaded from this panel in both SBOL and GenBank format. They form the basic requirement for further use of the NRPSDesigner output, e.g. with available Bio-CAD tools. </p>

               <p> <span class="label label-important">Important</span> Finally, note that synthetic NRPS have also been proven to be functional when an adenylation domain natively found in an elongation module is used as the initation domain. The consequence for the NRPSDesigner is that returned NRPS coding sequences may start without a start codon. Thus, in the subsequent steps of design of an appropriate cloning strategy, it is essential to introduce a start codon e.g. by including it in the backbone.</p>


            <h2> Cloning strategy </h2>
            <p>The previously mentioned step comprise the core functionality of the NRPSDesigner: The calculation of appropriate DNA sequences and their source, which after assembly and transformation will lead to the production of a non-ribosomal peptide of choice. Thus, the subsequent steps can range from direct synthesis to diverse cloning techniques, such as Golden Gate, CPEC or Gibson assembly. </p>

            <p>In fact, it is highly encouraged to use your own tool for CAD DNA design and assembly for the next steps, for example commercial offerings such as <a href="http://www.teselagen.com/"> teselagen's platform </a> or <a href="http://j5.jbei.org/index.php/Main_Page"> J5 </a>. Nevertheless, here we already provide an in-built solution for the CAD DNA assembly, namely Gibthon.

                <h3> About Gibthon </h3>
                 <img src={% static "images/documentation/gibthon2.0beta.png" %} />

                 <p> <a href="http://django.gibthon.org/"> Gibthon </a> was started as the software project of the Cambridge iGEM teams of 2010 and 2011 and comprises an open source tool which aids "in the design and manufacture of synthetic parts and devices for biological systems." The manufacture of the synthetic parts is accomplished by means of Gibson assembly, a technique for one-pot isothermal and scarless assembly of DNA fragments. Gibthon was chosen because of its user-friendly interface, which rapidly allows the scientist to use his expertise and modify the Gibson assembly primer suggestions by having direct access to the sequences the primer is complementary too. After each such modification, important primer properties, e.g. regarding self-priming are recalculated using UNAfold. In the next sections, the modified version of Gibthon for integration with the NRPSDesigner and its use will be explained. </p>

                <h3> Fragment library        <span class="label label-warning">[Login required]</span>
 </h3>


                <img src={% static "images/documentation/fragmentLibrary.png" %} />

                <p>The first step when using Gibthon is to add the appropriate DNA fragments that have to be assembled to the library. In the case of the NRPSDesigner, the coding sequence for the Synthetase is automatically returned. Yet, you still need to add your own DNA parts, for example a backbone with a promoter and a ribosome binding site. Note that some biological devices of general use available from the <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Main_Page"> Parts Registry </a> are available to all users. </p>

               <p> Logged-in users also have the ability to manage their own library of fragments for Gibson assembly and use those parts in their different NRPS constructs, as required. This can be achieved from the "apps" dropdown and then choosing "Manage Gibson fragments". There, a user can manage all the parts that he has already added (e.g. delete them or download their DNA sequence), as well as add new parts, as seen in the screenshot above. The current version includes API access to both the iGEM parts registry and NCBI. Of course it also possible to add sequences by submitting FASTA/Genbank files or by copying the raw sequence string. </p>

                <h3> Plasmid view #2</h3>
                <p>For use of Gibthon for a Gibson assembly strategy, the previously presented dynamic plasmid view can be utilized. In particular, parts that have been added to the user specific Gibson fragment library (for registered users) or globally available parts (available to all users) can be added to the plasmid by simple drag and drop. Dragging towards the inner side of the plasmid results in the fragments being entered in the reverse direction (as seen in the screenshot below), else the sequence is added in the forward direction. </p>
                <img src={% static "images/documentation/gibthon2.png" %} />

                <p> The behaviour in the previously mentioned step is similar to the one present in the original Gibthon web-server, but with one important difference: Other fragments can't be entered into the plasmid in such a way so as to break the returned sequence of NRPS domains. Thus, other DNA sequences can be embedded in the plasmid only after the thioesterase (TE) domain or before the initialization adenylation domain. </p>

                <p> <span class="label label-important">Important</span> As already mentioned, it is very important to ensure the addition of a promoter, a ribosome binding site and a start codon in the final sequence!</p>

                    <h3> Primers </h3>
                    <p> If you click on the "Primers" tab, you will initially come across the following: </p>

                     <img src={% static "images/documentation/designPrimer.png" %} />

                    <p> Clicking on "Process primers", will calculate appropriate primers, as seen on the next screenshot: </p>

                      <img src={% static "images/documentation/primerOverview.png" %} />

                    <p> In particular, the generated overview of the primers, includes a graphical display of the fragments to be assembled and the corresponding primers. For each of these, the visual representation shows to which fragment the annealing sequence of the primer binds to and to which fragment the Gibson overhang is complementary to. In addition, a small table which summarizes all the primers, their length and their melting temperature (annealing end, whole primer). In the example above, 8 primers have been generated, corresponding to the 4 fragments (3 NRPS sequences, 1 backbone). </p>

                    <p> Also note, that the graphical representation of the primers, can include a number (inside a red box). This numbers corresponds to the number of  the following types of warnings: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>T<sub>m</sub> warning: the annealing temperature of either the annealing portion or the whole primer 
            is less than the target</li>
            <li>Self prime warning: the primer could potentially prime to itself on the 3' end</li>
            <li>Misprime warning: the primer could potentially prime elsewhere on the fragment</li>
        </ul>

        <p> The last two warning are actually calculated by UNAfold. </p>

        <p> For more information about a specific primer, one can click on it (in the graphical representation), as exemplified in the following screenshot: </p>

        <img src={% static "images/documentation/specificPrimer.png" %} />

        <p> Note that the primer specific view includes the sequence of the Primer, as well as a graphical representation of the primer and the two corresponding DNA sequences: The DNA sequence which gets amplified with PCR due to the 3' sticky end of the primer, as well as the sequence which will be combined with the aforementioned one during Gibson assembly. The view also includes a detailed description of all the warnings and a boxplot generated by UNAfold (see next section). Clicking on a particular base pair of the DNA sequences on the graphical view, will save the primer with the new length and the warnings and melting temperature will be recalculated. </p>
<br/>
                    <h4> Boxplot </h4>
          <br/>
    <img src={% static "images/documentation/boxplot.png" %} />
    <p>A sample self-priming boxplot is shown above. This is the output of the folding program used to determine whether any self annealing will occur.
    Each mark on the plot represents a possible basepairing. The colour determines the likelyhood of pairing forming.</p>

    <p>Black represents the lowest free energy, followed by red, green, and yellow. The lower the free energy, the more likely the structure is to form.
    As a general rule of thumb, if it is positive, it will be fine. If it is greater than ~-3kcal/mol, it will probably be OK. Any lower than this and,
    depending on position, you will probably want to consider redesigning your primers.</p>

    <p>The right hand side of the plot corresponds to the 3' end of the primer. If there are any marks on this column, then the 3' end may be bound
    to another part of the primer. This will prevent extension of the primer along the target fragemnt. Note that the boxplot auto-scales to fit the provided data,
    so make sure you compare the number in the top right with the length of your primer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This boxplot has a number of potential secondary structures forming. However, the most likely to form (at 22 bp from the 5' end) still has quite a high free energy,
    and due to its position is unlikely to affect the ability of the 3' end to extend. The original primer was 40bp long, so the secondary structure forming at 39bp from the 5' end
    does not includ= the 3' base pair. It is also a much higher free energy, and so is very unlikely to appear.</p>
                    <h3> Downloadable output </h3>
                   <p> All of the content readily available on the online interface, can also be downloaded in a convenient format. In particular, a .zip file with the contents seen below is returned: </p>
           
           <img src={% static "images/documentation/downloadableOutput.png" %} />

           <p>In particular, the downloaded archive contains an annotated description of the DNA sequences to be assembled in both the <a href="http://www.sbolstandard.org/"> SBOL </a> (Synthetic Biology Open Language) format, as well as in the GenBank format. Thus, those files can be edited and inspected using most available CAD-tools for biological assembly. A pdf describing the contents of the .zip archive, summarizing the source of the different DNA fragments to be assembled and also describing the Gibson assembly protocol to be used, is also returned. The PCR folder includes suggestions for the reactions necessary for the amplification of the appropriate fragments. Finally, the primers and their sequences are returned in a tabular format ("primers.csv"):</p>

           <img src={% static "images/documentation/primerTable.png" %} />

           <p> This table contains the sequence of the primers, their length, as well as their melting temperature (including floppy ends). Thus, the primers can be quickly ordered from commercial providers. </p>

            <h2> Combinatorial libraries <span class="label label-warning">[Login required]</span></h2>
            <p> For logged-in users, the NRPSDesigner also provides an experimental feature for high-throughput generation of peptide libraries by starting from a given scaffold (with applications for example in the case of production of novel antibiotics by starting from a known non-ribosomal peptide antibiotic). Thus, the login requirement is enforced, because the procedure can only begin from a succesfully cloned NRPS construct, as designed in one of the previous steps and saved in a user-specific session. In particular, the user can visit his collection of designed NRPs and then click on the downwards-pointing arrow of the button of his peptide of choice and then choose "Create library", as seen in the screenshot below.</p>



            <img src={% static "images/documentation/createLibrary.png" %} />

            <p> In the library view, the sequence of monomers of the NRP produced by the scaffold is highlighted. The heuristic utilized here for high throughput is the following: For the creation of a library, one particular monomer position can be shuffled with many different other monomers. Thus, most of the primers for the rest of the scaffold can be reused and only the set of primers necessary for the domain to be shuffled has to be ordered. The corresponding interface can be seen in the screenshot below: </p>

            <img src={% static "images/documentation/library.png" %} />

            <p> The monomer position to be exchanged can be chosen by clicking on the corresponding <i class="icon-ok"></i> or <i class="icon-plus"></i> button. Choosing the <i class="icon-ok"></i> option leads to the shuffling of that particular position with all monomers of the database. On the other hand, by repeated clicking of the <i class="icon-plus"></i> button, a manual selection of monomers to be used for the exchange can be accomplished. Once preferences have been set, the appropriate constructs are designed by clicking on the "Design library" button. Note that depending on the number of monomers, this procedure could take a long time. Once the calculation is ready, a downloadable output with SBOL/GenBank files, as well as primers, similar to the one described for the scaffold construct, is returned. </p>

            <h2> Extending the database <span class="label label-warning">[Login required]</span></h2> 
            <p> As mentioned previously, every user can extend the NRPSDesigner database by adding new NRPS pathways (with the safety mechanism of distinguishing between sequences entered by curators or normal users). This functionality can be accessed from the "Apps" dropdown by choosing the "Add NRPS into library" option. Exemplary, a sample input of the tycB gene is shown below: </p>

            <img src={% static "images/documentation/dbInput.png" %} />
            <p> Beyond the source organism and the product synthesized in the native organism, the DNA sequence has to be entered. This can be a raw string or a FASTA formatted sequence. Here a number of conditions are checked: The DNA sequence entered has to be a coding sequence. Thus, its length has to be a multiple of 3 and it has to begin with a start codon, end with a stop codon and no stop codons should be interspersed within the gene (start/stop codon definition according to the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Utils/wprintgc.cgi#SG11"> NCBI Bacterial, Archaeal and Plant Plastid Code </a>). If one of these conditions is violated, then appropriate warnings are returned. </p>

            <p> Once everything has been entered, the request can be submitted to the NRPSDesigner server by pressing the "Generate Domains" button. The pipeline based on hidden markov models (HMM) then detects all NRPS domains. If none is found, then an appropriate error message is returned. In the example of the tycB gene, 11 domains are detected and returned. </p>

             <img src={% static "images/documentation/HMMoutput.png" %} />

             <p> Once this output has been returned, manual curation has to take place: This includes adding appropriate descriptions to the files, checking or adding specificities to the adenylation domains and checking domain boundaries, for example with the in-built multiple sequence alignment. Pressing on the "Save cds and domains!" button results in the storage of all the previously entered and predicted information to the NRPSDesigner database. </p>

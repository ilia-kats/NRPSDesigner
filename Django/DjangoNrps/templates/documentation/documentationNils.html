                    <p>The previously mentioned step comprise the core functionality of the NRPSDesigner: The calculation of appropriate DNA sequences and their source, which after assembly and transformation will lead to the production of a non-ribosomal peptide of choice. Thus, the subsequent steps can range from direct synthesis to diverse cloning techniques, such as Golden Gate, CPEC or Gibson assembly. </p>

                    <p>In fact, it is highly encouraged to use your own tool for CAD DNA design and assembly for the next steps, for example commercial offerings such as <a href="http://www.teselagen.com/"> teselagen's platform </a> or <a href="http://j5.jbei.org/index.php/Main_Page"> J5 </a>. Nevertheless, here we already provide an in-built solution for the CAD DNA assembly, namely Gibthon.</p>

                    <h3> About Gibthon </h3>
                 <img src="../../static/images/documentation/gibthon2.0beta.png" %} />

                 <p> <a href="http://django.gibthon.org/"> Gibthon </a> was started as the software project of the Cambridge iGEM teams of 2010 and 2011 and comprises an open source tool which aids "in the design and manufacture of synthetic parts and devices for biological systems." The manufacture of the synthetic parts is accomplished by means of Gibson assembly, a technique for one-pot isothermal and scarless assembly of DNA fragments. Gibthon was chosen because of its user-friendly interface, which rapidly allows the scientist to use his expertise and modify the Gibson assembly primer suggestions by having direct access to the sequences the primer is complementary too. After each such modification, important primer properties, e.g. regarding self-priming are recalculated using UNAfold. In the next sections, the modified version of Gibthon for integration with the NRPSDesigner and its use will be explained. </p>

                    <h4> Primers </h4>
                    <p> If you click on the "Primers" tab, you will initially come upon the following: </p>

                     <img src="../../static/images/documentation/designPrimer.png"/>

                    <p> Clicking on "Process primers", will calculate appropriate primers, as seen on the next screenshot: </p>

                      <img src="../../static/images/documentation/primerOverview.png" />

                    <p> In particular, the generated overview of the primers, includes a graphical display of the fragments to be assembled and the corresponding primers. For each of these, the visual representation shows to which fragment the annealing sequence of the primer binds to and to which fragment the Gibson overhang is complementary to. In addition, a small table which summarizes all the primers, their length and their melting temperature (annealing end, whole primer). In the example above, 8 primers have been generated, corresponding to the 4 fragments (3 NRPS sequences, 1 backbone). </p>

                    <p> Also note, that the graphical representation of the primers, can include a number (inside a red box). This numbers corresponds to the number of  the following types of warnings: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>T<sub>m</sub> warning: the annealing temperature of either the annealing portion or the whole primer 
            is less than the target</li>
            <li>Self prime warning: the primer could potentially prime to itself on the 3' end</li>
            <li>Misprime warning: the primer could potentially prime elsewhere on the fragment</li>
        </ul>

        <p> The last two warning are actually calculated by UNAfold. </p>

        <p> For more information about a specific primer, one can click on it (in the graphical representation), as exemplified in the following screenshot: </p>

        <img src="../../static/images/documentation/specificPrimer.png" />

        <p> Note that the primer specific view includes the sequence of the Primer, as well as a graphical representation of the primer and the two corresponding DNA sequences: The DNA sequence which gets amplified with PCR due to the 3' sticky end of the primer, as well as the sequence which will be combined with the aforementioned one during Gibson assembly. The view also includes a detailed description of all the warnings and a boxplot generated by UNAfold (see next section). Clicking on a particular base pair of the DNA sequences on the graphical view, will save the primer with the new length and the warnings and melting temperature will be recalculated. </p>

                    <h4> Boxplot </h4>
          
    <img src={% static "images/documentation/boxplot.png" %} />
    <p>A sample self-priming boxplot is shown above. This is the output of the folding program used to determine whether any self annealing will occur.
    Each mark on the plot represents a possible basepairing. The colour determines the likelyhood of pairing forming.</p>

    <p>Black represents the lowest free energy, followed by red, green, and yellow. The lower the free energy, the more likely the structure is to form.
    As a general rule of thumb, if it is positive, it will be fine. If it is greater than ~-3kcal/mol, it will probably be OK. Any lower than this and,
    depending on position, you will probably want to consider redesigning your primers.</p>

    <p>The right hand side of the plot corresponds to the 3' end of the primer. If there are any marks on this column, then the 3' end may be bound
    to another part of the primer. This will prevent extension of the primer along the target fragemnt. Note that the boxplot auto-scales to fit the provided data,
    so make sure you compare the number in the top right with the length of your primer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This boxplot has a number of potential secondary structures forming. However, the most likely to form (at 22 bp from the 5' end) still has quite a high free energy,
    and due to its position is unlikely to affect the ability of the 3' end to extend. The original primer was 40bp long, so the secondary structure forming at 39bp from the 5' end
    does not includ= the 3' base pair. It is also a much higher free energy, and so is very unlikely to appear.</p>
